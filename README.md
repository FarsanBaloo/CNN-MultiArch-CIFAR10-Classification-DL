# CNN-MultiArch-CIFAR10-Classification-DL

## Overview

This project implements and evaluates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification as part of the course
**DVA307 – Deep Learning and Neural Networks** at Mälardalen University (2025).

The lab explores multiple CNN architectures, training them on benchmark datasets, and analyzing their performance.

## Key Learnings

* **CNN fundamentals:** convolution, pooling, and feature hierarchies
* **Architectural differences:**

  * *AlexNet* – early deep CNN, large filters and fully connected layers
  * *ResNet18* – residual connections enabling deeper training
  * *MobileNetV1/V2* – efficient CNNs using depthwise separable convolutions
* **Datasets:** FashionMNIST (grayscale clothing images) and CIFAR-10 (color natural images)
* **Training process:** data augmentation, cross-entropy loss, and Adam optimizer
* **Performance analysis:** architecture choice impacts accuracy, model size, and inference speed
